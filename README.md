Basic Accounting Calculator

Description:I created this calculator because my girlfriend just recently started her accounting career
and asked me to make her a personal calculator withfunctions she needed for her work

Dependencies:access to a web browser

Usage:This can be a useful tool for students studying accounting and people actually in the field

Future Developement:This template of a calculator has so much potential for future developement, there are so many useful functions that I
have not added such as square root, positive negative button(even though i still have it so you can plug in a negative number using the
minus sign), etc.
